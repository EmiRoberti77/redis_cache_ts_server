## Title:

Redis cashe to store user data

## Decision:

I choose to use Redis because i can use fast indexes to store user journey data from other systems into a separate database

## Status:

in order to make the system easy to deplopy i wanted to have cloud based solution, and Redis offers local and now cloud service with outscaling

## Consequences:

I have decided to write a node service that will take in user information and store keys is <user>:<id>:<timestampe>

```typescript
const promptSchema = new Schema(
  "prompt",
  {
    question: { type: "string" },
    answer: { type: "string" },
    user: { type: "string" },
    dateTime: { type: "date" },
  },
  {
    dataStructure: "JSON",
  }
);
```

i will probably add a TTL to the indes to keep redis cache clean on each index ( maybe 30 days )
